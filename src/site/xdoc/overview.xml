      <p>MaPSeq is fronted by a collection of service interfaces
      (SOAP, RESTful, and Messaging).  When a pipeline is deployed, a
      Java Messaging Service destination will be exposed.  That
      messaging destination, only accepting valid JSON messages, will
      enqueue a WorkflowRun instance for that cooresponding workflow
      along with a specified Flowcell/Sample to process.</p>

      <subsection name="Web Services">
	<p>The MaPSeq service interfaces are deployed as both RESTful
	services as well as SOAP services using Apache CXF.  Please
	refer to the <a href="images/edu.unc.mapseq.ws.png">Web
	Service API</a> for details</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Schema">
	<p>The MaPSeq data model is a joined inheritance model.  There
	are two distinct inheritance models, one for dictionary items
	(Workflow, Study) and another for named entities (Flowcell,
	Sample).  For reference, <a href="schema1.xsd">MaPSeq XSD</a></p>

      <p>There are two deployment parts to MaPSeq.</p>
      <subsection name="Main">
	<p>The "mapseq-main" project is the first part in deploying MaPSeq and intends to provide a "client-side" solution for using MaPSeq web services.</p>
	<p>After a full build, a tarball will be created in the '&lt;mapseq&gt;/mapseq-main/target' directory.  This tarball contains all the dependencies and modules from the mapseq-modules sub-project.  This tarball should be deployed to a shared file system which will be found by referencing the "MAPSEQ_HOME" env found in your ~/.mapseqrc file.</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Distribution">
	<p>The "mapseq-distribution" project is the second part of deploying MaPSeq and intends to provide the "server-side" of MaPSeq.  Karaf is embedded in this distribution and all that is required to build it is to run "mvn clean install" in the '&lt;mapseq&gt;/mapseq-distribution/' directory.  A tarball wll be created in the '&lt;mapseq&gt;/mapseq-distribution/target' directory and, once exploded, run the '&lt;mapseq&gt;/mapseq-distribution/bin/mapseq' or '&lt;mapseq&gt;/mapseq-distribution/bin/start' command.</p>

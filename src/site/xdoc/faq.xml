      <subsection name="Can jobs be exported to LSF/SGE/other?">
	<p>Yes and no.  HTCondor manages execution of jobs within the
	directed acyclic graph.  If the batch scheduler supports DAG
	job types, then it is possible.  For example LSF can have the
	"name" of a job specified as a dependency...allowing a
	chaining of the vertexes of the graph.  Not all batch
	schedulers support this.</p>
